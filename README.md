## 📌 Development Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Salary Prediction Model (MVP)** ✅

* Build a machine learning model for salary range prediction.
* Dataset(From Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/software-professional-salaries-2022/data
* Input features: candidate background, role, location, job description, etc.
* Output: expected salary range.

### **Phase 2: LLM-Powered Agent** ✨

* Integrate an LLM agent to provide richer, contextual insights.
* Consider additional inputs such as:
  * Time of application (timestamp data).
  * Relocation requirements.
  * Role-specific requirements.
* Goal: make predictions more **context-aware**.

### **Phase 3: Community Insights (Future Work)** 🔍

* Expand the LLM agent to incorporate **community-driven data** (e.g., Reddit, Glassdoor).
* Example:
  > “Based on similar profiles and postings, applicants with comparable experience tend to receive offers in the range of \$X–\$Y.”
